My Visualization
==
For this assignment, I created a visualization including a stoplight and car. The stoplight is made of a rectangle, three circles, and a line. The car is a piece of clipart I found online and cited below. Additionally, I put two tire images over the car, also cited below.

Sources for Coding Assistance

* https://observablehq.com/@nyuvis/d3-introduction
  * This was the first source I consulted, and where I was inspired to do the array of circles. I used the code here to learn how to display an array of svg shapes. I edited the code to be three circles vertically stacked, with different colors, to repersent a traffic light.
* https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp 
  * The first source did not describe how to actually make an array in JavaScript, so I learned how to here.
* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/circle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference)
  * I used the elements and attributes lists in this documentation to create each of my svg elements: circles, a rectangle, a line, and images. I also used it to learn the transform attribute and rotate my tires. 
* https://d3js.org/d3-selection/events and https://d3js.org/d3-timer
  * I used this d3 documentation to create my animation.
* https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/discussions/530
  * This showed me how to get my images I uploaded to GitHub into my actual code.
